# Human-Body-Temperature-Simulation
This project tries to simulation the response of human body temperature to ambient temperature, and the effect of environment factors
like windspeed, sunshine, physical activities and so on. The main purpose is to verify the conclusion from this paper by Sherwood and Huber(http://www.pnas.org/content/107/21/9552.abstract) that exposing to an environment with Twet > 35 degrees C for a few hours can cause fatal heat exhaustion. However, we think the 35 degree is an optimistic estimation and the reality might be worse. For more information, keep tuned for our future publication. 

The project includes two seperate experiment, one is calculating the equilibrium temperature, the other one is calculating the time
it requries to reach the equilibrium. 

The .h files contain all the mathematical equations.
