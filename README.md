# Human-Body-Temperature-Simulation
This project tries to simulation the response of human body temperature to ambient temperature, and the effect of environment factors
like windspeed, sunshine, physical activities and so on. 

The project includes two seperate experiment, one is calculating the equilibrium temperature, the other one is calculating the time
it requries to reach the equilibrium.
